# CTF
Capture The Flag is a 'virtual game' for people interested in cybersecurity where the goal is to find a file (or passowrd) located in a machine. It gives the participants the opportunity to prove their algorithmic skills and Shell scripting knowledge.

### Over The Wire
Over The Wire is a website (https://overthewire.org/) with different 'wargames' aimed for CTF begginers to get the basics of the game. OTW doesn't allow to publicly post solutions, this is the reason why they are posted in a private repo. I will be updating solutions for each level with Shell scripts as I progress on the game.
