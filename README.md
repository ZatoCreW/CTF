# EduProjects
This is a private repo with a collection of ML and algorithmic exercises that I have solved in educational and side projects. I'm showing them for employability purposes only so please, do not share these files with other people without asking for permission. As I am still in my educational phase, this repo will be updated with CS related stuff that I find interesting.
So far, folders you will find in this repo are:

## Machine Learning
Collection of lab assignments that I solved in an educational environment and other data science challenges (e.g. Kaggle and others) or datasets that I have taken a look at.

## CTF
Capture The Flag is a 'virtual game' for people interested in cybersecurity where the goal is to find a file (or passowrd) located in a machine. It gives the participants the opportunity to prove their algorithmic skills and Shell scripting knowledge.

### Over The Wire
Over The Wire is a website (https://overthewire.org/) with different 'wargames' aimed for CTF begginers to get the basics of the game. OTW doesn't allow to publicly post solutions, this is the reason why they are posted in a private repo. I will be updating solutions for each level with Shell scripts as I progress on the game.
